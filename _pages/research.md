My main research passion is on building autonomous agent that learns to act rationally in various environments, which is generally referred to as reinforcement learning (RL). I have been working on [finding efficient ways to explore RL environments](https://liuanji.github.io/publication/2019-09-05-AAC) and [deploying novel parallelization Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms for large scale Game AI tasks](https://liuanji.github.io/publication/2019-09-25-P-UCT).
