I am currently a visiting researcher at [Statistical and Relational Artificial Intelligence (StarAI) lab](http://starai.cs.ucla.edu/members/) in UCLA, led by professor [Guy Van den Broeck](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~guyvdb/). My research passion is on the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and tractable inference models that add domain knowledge as well as model uncertainty in the environment. Before joining StarAI lab, I was a machine learning intern at Seattle AI Lab, Kwai Inc. During my internship, I worked on game AI and reinforcement learning. Before that, I completed my BS in Automation at the school of automation science and electrical engineering in [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) (BUAA), working under the advisement of professor [Yuanjun Laili](http://shi.buaa.edu.cn/yunglynn/en/index.htm).
